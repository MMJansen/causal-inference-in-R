There are no unmeasured confounders\n2.  Every subject has a nonzero probability of receiving either exposure\n\n## Logistic Regression\n\nThere are many ways to estimate the propensity score; typically people use logistic regression for binary exposures.\nThis is done by fitting a logistic regression model predicting the exposure using known confounders.\nEach individual's predicted value is the propensity score.\nIn R, a logistic regression model can be fit using the `glm()` function.\nBelow is pseudo-code.\nThe first argument is the model, with the exposure on the left side and the confounders on the right.\nThe data frame is passed to the `data` argument and the `family = binomial()` argument to denote the model should be fit using logistic regression (as opposed to a different generalized linear model).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm(\n  exposure ~ confounder_1 + confounder_2,\n  data = df,\n  family = binomial()\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can extract the propensity scores by pulling out the predictions on the probability scale.\nUsing the `augment()` function from the [{`broom`}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package, we can extract these propensity scores and add them to our original data frame.\nThe argument `type.predict` is set to `\"response\"` to indicate that we want to extract the predicted values on the *probability* scale.\nBy default, these will be on the linear logit scale.\nThe `data` argument contains the original data frame.\nThis code will output a new data frame consisting of all components in `df` with six additional columns corresponding to the logistic regression model that was fit.\nThe `.fitted` column is the propensity score.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm(\n  exposure ~ confounder_1 + confounder_2,\n  data = df,\n  family = binomial()\n) |>\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\", data = df)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's look at an example.\n\n### Example\n\nHistorically, guests who stayed in a Walt Disney World resort hotel were able to access the park during \"Extra Magic Hours\" during which the park was closed to all other guests.\nThese extra hours could be in the morning or evening.\nThe Seven Dwarfs Mine Train is a ride at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom.\nTypically, each day Magic Kingdom may or may not be selected to have these \"Extra Magic Hours\".\nWe are interested in examining the relationship between whether there were \"Extra Magic Hours\" in the morning and the average wait time for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train the same day between 5pm and 6pm.\nBelow is a proposed DAG for this question.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proposed DAG for the relationship between Extra Magic Hours in the morning at a particular park and the average wait time between 5pm and 6pm.](chapter-08_files/figure-pdf/dag-magic-hours-wait-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere we are proposing that there are three confounders: the historic high temperature on the day, the time the park closed, and the ticket season: value, regular, or peak.\nWe can build a propensity score model using the `seven_dwarfs_train_2018` data set from the [{`touringplans`}](https://lucymcgowan.github.io/touringplans/) package.\nEach row of this dataset contains information about the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train during a certain hour on a given day.\nFirst we need to subset the data to only include average wait times between 5 and 6 pm.\nThen we will use the `glm()` function to fit the propensity score model, predicting `extra_magic_morning` using the four confounders specified above.\nWe'll add the propensity scores to the data frame (in a column called `.fitted` as set by the `augment()` function in the {`broom`} package).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(touringplans)\n\nseven_dwarfs_17 <- seven_dwarfs_train_2018 |>\n  filter(hour == 17)\n\nseven_dwarfs_17_with_ps <- glm(\n  extra_magic_morning ~ wdw_ticket_season + close + weather_wdwhigh,\n  data = seven_dwarfs_17,\n  family = binomial()\n) |>\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\", data = seven_dwarfs_17)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at these propensity scores.\nBelow, the propensity scores are shown in the `.fitted` column for the first 6 observations.\nThe propensity score here is the probability that a given date will have Extra Magic Hours in the morning given the observed confounders, in this case the historical high temperatures on a given date, the time the park closed, and Ticket Season.\nFor example, on January 1, 2018 there was a 30.4% chance that there would be Extra Magic Hours at the Magic Kingdom given the Ticket Season (peak in this case), time of park closure (11pm), and the historic high temperature on this date (70.3 degrees).\nOn this particular day, there were *not* Extra Magic Hours in the morning (as indicated by the 0 in the first row of the `extra_magic_morning` column).\n\n\n\n:::

to visualize this is via \"mirrored histograms\".\nThe code below creates two histograms of the propensity scores, one on the \"top\" for the exposed group (the dates with Extra Magic Hours in the morning) and one on the \"bottom\" for the unexposed group.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(\n    data = seven_dwarfs_17_with_ps |> filter(extra_magic_morning ==

{.cell-output-display}\n![Mirrored histograms of estimated propensity scores for Extra Magic Hour days (exposed group) and days without Extra Magic hours (unexposed group)](chapter-08_files/figure-pdf/mirrored-ps-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the code above, the first `geom_histogram()` call creates the top histogram by subsetting the `seven_dwarfs_with_ps` data frame to only include those in the exposure group, where `extra_magic_morning == 1`.\nThe x-axis for the histogram is the propensity score, which lives in the `.fitted` column of the data frame.\nThe second `geom_histogram()` call creates the bottom histogram, subsetting to only those in the unexposed group, where `extra_magic_morning == 0`.\nHere, we use the `y` argument to *flip* the histogram by setting this to `-after_stat(count)`.\n`after_stat()` allows you to work with values created internally by ggplot2, such as `count`, the frequency counts for the histogram.\nFinally, we need to edit the y-axis to show the absolute value (rather than negative values below 0) so the correct numbers are displayed; this is accomplished by setting `label = abs` in the `scale_y_continuous()` function.\n\nHere are some diagnostic insights we gain from Figure \\@ref(fig:mirrored-ps).\n\n1.  Look for lack of overlap as a potential positivity problem. But too much overlap may be indicative of a poor model(? not necessarily. depends on the relative covariate distributions in the two groups).\n2.  Avg treatment effect among treated easier to estimate with precision (because of higher counts) than the control group.\n3.  A single outlier in either group with respect to range could be a problem and warrant data inspection (TODO: do this here?) *look at the model coefs here*.\n\n*TODO* This may be a \"nice\" example -- should we also show a bad model (maybe only with ticket season or possibly overspecifying it)\n\n## Choosing what variables to include\n\nThe best way to decide what variables to include in your propensity score model is to look at your DAG and have at least a minimal adjustment set of confounders.\nOf course, sometimes, essential variables are missing or measured with error.\nIn addition, there is often more than one theoretical adjustment set that debiases your estimate; it may be that one of the minimal adjustment sets is measured well in your data set and another is not.\nIf you have confounders on your DAG that you do not have access to, sensitivity analyses can help quantify the potential impact.\nSee Chapter 11 for an in-depth discussion of sensitivity analyses.\n\nAccurately specifying a DAG improves our ability to add the correct variables to our models.\nHowever, confounders are not the only necessary type of variable to consider.\nFor example, variables that are predictors of the *outcome* *but not the exposure* can improve the precision of propensity score models.\nConversely, including variables that are predictors of the *exposure but not the outcome* (instrumental variables) can bias the model.\nLuckily, in practice, it seems that this bias is relatively negligible, especially compared to the risk of confounding bias [@Myers2011].\n\nAnother type of variable to be wary of is a *collider*, a variable that is a descendant of both the exposure and the outcome.\nIf you specify your DAG correctly, you can avoid colliders by only using adjustment sets that completely close backdoor paths from the exposure to the outcome.\nHowever, some circumstances make this difficult: some colliders are inherently stratified by the study's design or the nature of follow-up.\nFor example, loss-to-follow-up is a common source of collider-stratification bias; in Chapter XX, we'll discuss this further.\n\nA variable can also be both a confounder and a collider, as in the case of so-called butterfly bias:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggdag(butterfly_bias())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-08_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf we have all the variables measured well, we can avoid adjusting form by adjusting for either `a` or `b`.\nHowever, what should we do if we don't have those variables?\nAdjusting for `m` opens a biasing pathway that we cannot block through `a` and `b` (collider stratification bias), but `m` is also a confounder for `x` and `y`.\nAs in the case above, it appears that confounding bias is often the worse of the two options, so we should adjust for `m` unless we have reason to believe it will cause more problems than it solves [@DingMiratrix2015].\n\n### Don't use prediction metrics for causal modeling\n\nBy and large, metrics commonly used for building prediction models are inappropriate for building causal models.\nResearchers and data scientists often make decisions about models using metrics like R^2^, AUC, accuracy, and (often inappropriately) p-values.\nHowever, a causal model's goal is not to predict as much about the outcome as possible [@hernán2021]; the goal is to accurately estimate the relationship between the exposure and outcome.\nA causal model needn't predict particularly well to be unbiased.\n\nWhere these metrics serve a role is identifying the best *functional form* of a model.\nGenerally, we'll use DAGs and our domain knowledge to build the model itself.\nHowever, we may be unsure of the mathematical relationship between a confounder and the outcome or exposure.\nFor instance, we may not know if the relationship is linear.\nMisspecifying this relationship can lead to residual confounding: we may only partially account for the confounder in question, leaving some bias in the estimate.\nTesting different functional forms using prediction-focused metrics can help improve the accuracy of the model itself, potentially allowing for better control.\n\nAnother technique researchers sometimes use to determine confounders is to add a variable and determine the percent change in the coefficient between the outcome and exposure.\nFor instance, we first model `y ~ x` to estimate the relationship between `x` and `y`.\nThen, we model `y ~ x + z` and see how much the coefficient on `x` has changed.\nA common rule is to add a variable if it changes the coefficient of `x` by 10%.\n\nUnfortunately, this technique is unreliable.\nAs we've discussed, controlling for mediators, colliders, and instrumental variables all affect the estimate of the relationship between `x` and `y`, and usually they result in bias.\nIn other words, there are many other types of variables besides confounders that can cause a change in the coefficient of the exposure.\nAs we discuss above, confounding bias is often the most important factor, but systematically searching your variables for anything that changes the coefficient of the exposure can compound many types of bias.\n\n::: def-box\nSome types of estimates, such as the odds ratio and hazard ratio, suffer from an additional problem called *non-collapsibility*.\nFor these types of estimates, adding noise variables (that is, variables that are not related to the exposure or outcome) don't reduce precision: they can bias the estimate as well--more the reason to avoid data-driven approaches to selecting variables for causal models.\n:::\n",
