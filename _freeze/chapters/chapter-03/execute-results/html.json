To do this, we attempt to control for all factors that are related to an exposure and outcome such that we can *construct* (or estimate) such a counterfactual outcome.\n\nLet's think about a specific example.\nIce-T, best known as an American rapper and Fin on Law and Order: SVU, co-authored a book titled \"Split Decision: Life Stories\", published in 2022.\nHere is the synopsis:\n\n> **Award-winning actor, rapper, and producer Ice-T unveils a compelling memoir of his early life robbing jewelry stores until he found fame and fortune---while a handful of bad choices sent his former crime partner down an incredibly different path.**\\\n> \\\n> Ice-T rose to fame in the late 1980s, earning acclaim for his music before going on to enthrall television audiences as Odafin \\\"Fin\\\" Tutuola in *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit*.\n> But it could have gone much differently.\\\n>\n> \\\n> In this \\\"poignant and powerful\\\" (*Library Journal*, starred review) memoir, Ice-T and Spike, his former crime partner---collaborating with *New York Times* bestselling author Douglas Century---relate the shocking stories of their shared pasts, and how just a handful of decisions led to their incredibly different lives.\n> Both grew up in violent, gang-controlled Los Angeles neighborhoods and worked together to orchestrate a series of jewelry heists.\\\n>\n> \\\n> But while Ice-T was discovered rapping in a club and got his first record deal, Spike was caught for a jewelry robbery and did three years in prison.\n> As his music career began to take off, Ice made the decision to abandon the criminal life; Spike continued to plan increasingly ingenious and risky jewel heists.\n> And in 1992, after one of Spike\\'s robberies ended tragically, he was sentenced to thirty-five years to life.\n> While he sat behind bars, he watched his former partner rise to fame in music, movies, and television.\\\n>\n> \\\n> \\\"Propulsive\\\" (*Publishers Weekly*, starred review), timely, and thoughtful, two men with two very different lives reveal how their paths might have very well been reversed if they made different choices.\n> All it took was a *split decision*. [@split]\n\n\n\nThis premise is compelling because it implies that we are observing a *counterfactual*.\nThe book begins by setting up all the ways Ice-T and his friend Spike were similar prior to some important moment (both grew up in Los Angeles neighborhoods, both were involved with gangs, both worked together to orchestrate a series of jewelry heists, etc).\nThen something happens -- Ice-T makes a decision to abandon criminal life and Spike makes the opposite decision.\nWhat happens next for Ice-T includes fame and fortune, while Spike ends up with 35 years to life in prison.\nThis book is attempting a small study, two people who prior to some event were the same and after were different -- Spike's outcomes serve as the counterfactual to Ice-T's.\n\n::: {#tbl-causal-map layout-ncol=1}\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| echo: false\nflowchart LR\n  A{Ice-T} --> |observed| B(Abandons criminal life)\n  A -.-> |missing counterfactual| C(Does one more heist)\n  C -.-> D[35 years in prison]\n  B --> E[Fame & Fortune]\n  \n  classDef grey fill:#ddd\n  class D,C grey\n```\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| echo: false\nflowchart LR\n  A{Spike} -.-> |missing counterfactual| B(Abandons criminal life)\n  A --> |observed| C(Does one more heist)\n  C --> D[35 years in prison]\n  B -.-> E[Fame & Fortune]\n  classDef grey fill:#ddd\n  class E,B grey\n```\n\n\nIce-T and Spike Causal Map\n:::\n\nIn practice, this is what we attempt to do with causal inference techniques. Even randomized trials are limited to a single factual world, so we compare the average effects of groups with different exposures.\nNow, having this as a concrete example of an attempt to construct a counterfactual scenario in the \"real-world\" there are several issues that we can immediately see, highlighting the difficulty in drawing such inference.\nFirst, while the synopsis implies that the two individuals were similar prior to the precipitating event that dictated their future opposite directions, we can easily identify factors in which perhaps they differed.\nIce-T decided to leave his life of crime, but that wasn't the only factor in his success: he had enough musical talent to make a career of it. Did Spike have Ice-T's musical talent?\nCan we really conclude that his life would have turned out exactly like Ice-T's if he had made the exact same choices as Ice-T?\nIf we want to truly estimate the causal effect of the decision to leave criminal life on Ice-T's future outcomes, we would need to observe his ultimate course both under making the decision and not.\nOf course this is not possible, so what can we do?\nPerhaps we can find someone else who is exactly like Ice-T who did not make the same decision and see how they fare.\nOf course, Ice-T is unique, it would be challenging to find someone exactly like him.\nAgain, this is attempted with Spike, and even so presents challenges.\nOften, instead of relying on a single individual, we rely on many individuals.\nWe could conduct an experiment where we *randomize* many individuals to leave criminal like (or not) and see how this impacts their outcomes *on average* (this randomized trial seems to present some ethical issues, perhaps we need to look to *observational* studies to help answer this question). In any case, we must rely on statistical techniques to help construct these unobservable counterfactuals.\n\n## Causal Assumptions {#sec-assump}\n\nLike most statistical approaches, the validity of a causal analysis depends on how well certain assumptions are met. Often we are interested in estimating the effect of some exposure on an outcome, often denoted as $Y$. One way to tackle this is to frame the problem using *potential outcomes* [@rubin1974estimating]. This framework envisions that each individual possesses a range of potential outcomes for every conceivable value of some input. For instance, in a scenario with two exposure levels (exposed: 1 and unexposed: 0), we can define potential outcomes for exposure ($Y(1)$) and no exposure ($Y(0)$), and subsequently analyze the difference between these outcomes, i.e., $Y(1) - Y(0)$, to comprehend the impact of the input (the exposure) on the outcome, $Y$. At any given time, only one of these *potential outcomes* is observable -- namely, the outcome tied to the actual exposure the individual underwent. Under certain assumptions, we can leverage data from individuals exposed to different inputs to compare the average differences in their observed outcomes. The most common assumptions across the approaches we describe in this book are:\n\n1. **Consistency**: We assume that the causal question you claim you are answering is consistent with the one you are *actually* answering with your analysis.\n\n2. **Well defined exposure**: We assume that for each value of the exposure, there is no difference between subjects in the delivery of that exposure. Put another way, multiple versions of the treatment do not exist.\n\n3. **No interference**: We assume that the outcome (technically all *potential* outcomes, regardless of whether they are observed) for any subject does not depend on another subject's exposure.\n\n4. **Exchangeability**: We assume that within levels of relevant variables (confounders), exposed and unexposed subjects have an equal likelihood of experiencing any outcome prior to exposure; i.e. the exposed and unexposed subjects are exchangeable. This assumption is sometimes referred to as **no unmeasured confounding**.\n\n5. **Positivity**: We assume that within each level and combination of the study variables used to achieve exchangeability, there are exposed and unexposed subjects. Said differently, each individual has some chance of experiencing every available exposure level. Sometimes this is referred to as the **probabilistic** assumption.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Jargon\n\nAssumptions 1 through 3 are sometimes referred to as *stable-unit-treatment-value-assumption* or SUTVA [@imbens2015causal]. Likewise, assumptions 1, 4, and 5 are referred to as *identifiability conditions* since we need them to hold in order to identify causal estimates. Technically, assumption 2 (well defined exposure) is part of assumption 1 (consistency), but we find it useful in practice to check the concerns separately.\n:::\n\nCausal assumptions can be difficult to verify and may not hold for many data collection strategies. We cannot overstate the importance of checking these criteria to the extent possible! Following any of the recipes in this book are unlikely to give valid answers if the causal assumptions are badly violated. \n\n\n\n",
