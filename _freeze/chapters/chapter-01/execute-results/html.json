using our study, the evidence shows *For people who smoke 15+ cigarettes a day, reducing smoking by 50% reduces the risk of lung cancer over 5-10 years*.\nDo these match?\nNot quite.\nLet's update our question to match what the study actually was able to show: *For people who smoke 15+ cigarettes a day, does reducing smoking by 50% reduce the lung cancer risk over 5-10 years?*.\nHoning this skill, asking answerable causal questions, is important, and one that we will discuss throughout this book.\n",
