## What is a counterfactual?

### Potential Outcomes

Before we talk about *counterfactuals,* let's begin by thinking about the philosophical concept of a *potential outcome.* Prior to some "cause" occurring, for example receiving some exposure, the *potential outcomes* are all of the potential things that could occur depending on what you end up exposed to.
For simplicity, let's assume an exposure has two levels:

-   $X=1$ if you are exposed

-   $X=0$ if you are not exposed

Under this simple scenario, there are two potential outcomes:

-   $Y(1)$ the potential outcome if you are exposed

-   $Y(0)$ the potential outcome if you are not exposed

Only *one* of these potential outcomes will actually be realized, the one corresponding to the exposure that actually occurred, and therefore only one is observable.
The *counterfactual* then is the value of the potential outcome corresponding to the exposure that did not occur.

Ultimately, our causal effect of interest is often some difference in potential outcomes $Y(1) - Y(0)$, in a particular population.

### Counterfactuals

Conceptually, a counterfactual outcome is one that would have occurred under a different set of circumstances.
In causal inference, we attempt to control for all factors that are related to an exposure and outcome such that we can construct a counterfactual outcome that would have occurred in the alternate universe where the exposure status for a given observation were flipped.

-   counterfactual: you have received a certain treatment and observe subsequently an outcome. What is the unrealized potential outcome if you had received the other treatment?
