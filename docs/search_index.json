In this book, we will… Part 1: Asking Causal Questions Chapter 1: What is a causal question? Description, prediction, and explanation Causal assumptions Whole game example Chapter 2: Expressing causal questions as DAGs Visualizing causal assumptions DAGs in R: ggdag and dagitty Chapter 3: Preparing data to answer causal questions Data wrangling with dplyr Recognizing missing data: visdat, tidyr, mice Working with multiple data sources Chapter 4: Observational data as causes and effects Exploring and visualizing data and assumptions: skimr, ggplot2 Calculating summary statistics: gtsummary, tableone Part 2: The counterfactual framework Chapter 5: Estimating counterfactuals What is a counterfactual? Target trials Estimating the average treatment effect Estimating treatment effects with other targets in mind Chapter 6 Building a propensity score models Logistic regression Choosing variables to include Continuous and categorical exposures Chapter 7: Using the propensity score Matching Weighting Weighting and matching with more complex exposures Chapter 8: Evaluating your propensity score model Calculating the standardized mean difference Visualizing balance via Love Plots, boxplots, and eCDF plots Pruning, trimming, and stabilizing propensity scores Part 3. Estimating causal effects Chapter 9: Incorporating propensity scores in generalized linear models Using matched data sets Using weights in outcome models Estimating uncertainty Estimating causal effects for complex exposures Chapter 10: Incorporating propensity scores in survival models Preparing data for survival analysis Pooled logistic regression Confidence intervals for causal survival models Chapter 11: Sensitivity analyses Quantitative bias analyses Tipping point analyses: tipr, EValue Chapter 12: Other approaches to causal inference G-computation Targeted Learning Instrumental variable analysis Regression discontinuity Difference-in-Difference "],["what-is-a-causal-question.html", "1 What is a causal question?", " 1 What is a causal question?
